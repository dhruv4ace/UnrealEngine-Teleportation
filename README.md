# Teleportation
 
This repository contains the code and assets for a Unreal Engine 5 project that showcases a teleportation ability system. The project includes a character that can teleport to different locations by aiming with a reticle and pressing a button.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Unreal Engine 5 installed on your system. You can download Unreal Engine 5 from the Epic Games Launcher.

Once you have Unreal Engine 5 installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in the editor.

Teleportation Ability System
The teleportation ability system in this project allows the player character to teleport to different locations in the game world. To use the system, the player must aim with a reticle and press right mouse button. The character will then teleport to the location indicated by the reticle.

The teleportation ability system is implemented using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5. The system uses ray tracing to detect the location of the reticle and calculates the destination for the teleportation.
